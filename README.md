# Dose pharmcy

This is a sample application that demonstrates an E-commerce website "Drug store" using HTTP,CSS,JS,Node js and express. The application loads 
products a MongoDB database and displays them. Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can 
click on any product to get more information including pricing. Users can select items and 
add them to their shopping cart.
Note:-Some things still in progress

## Import Data
It is still in progress, But I will include a data folder in this repo. Inside that folder will be 2 folders called cart and item. These 2 folders contain a mongodump of the 2 collections that I use in this ecommerce demo. You can use the [import-data.sh](data/import-data.sh) script to import these 2 dumps to an ecommerce database, then you will have the same content that I have for this demo.

## Live Demonstration

Dose can be [viewed online here](https://heba79.github.io/Dose/HTML/).

Here are screenshots that show the E-commerce demo application in use.
